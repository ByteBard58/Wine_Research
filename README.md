# 🍷 Wine Quality Classifier

A machine learning–powered web application that assesses the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties.
Built with **Flask**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Pandas**, this project blends oenology with machine learning to create an interactive tool for wine quality analysis.
This project demonstrates how data science can be applied to the food and beverage industry to standardize quality assessment.

___

## 🚀 Overview

The **Wine Quality Classifier** uses a trained **Machine Learning Model** (optimized via **GridSearchCV**) to predict whether a given wine sample is of **Low**, **Average**, or **High** quality.
The model is hosted via a **Flask** web app where users can input parameters (like acidity, sugar, and alcohol content) and get instant quality assessments.

## 🧠 Motivation

Wine tasting is traditionally a subjective art, reliant on the refined palates of sommeliers. However, the chemical composition of wine plays a decisive role in its quality.
This project aims to bridge the gap between chemistry and sensory experience, providing an objective, data-driven approach to classifying wine quality.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Wine Quality Dataset (WineQT)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)
- **Classes:**
  - `Low → 0` (Quality 3, 4)
  - `Average → 1` (Quality 5, 6)
  - `High → 2` (Quality 7, 8)
- **Features:**
  - Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid
  - Residual Sugar, Chlorides
  - Free & Total Sulfur Dioxide
  - Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol

## ⚙️ Model Architecture

The model generation pipeline (`fit.py`) includes the following steps:

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Imputation** | Missing values handled using median strategy |
| **Scaling** | Standardized with `StandardScaler` |
| **Augmentation** | SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for class balance |
| **Dimensionality** | PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for feature reduction |
| **Classifier** | Optimized Estimator (Random Forest / XGBoost / KNN) found via GridSearchCV |

Final model artifacts are serialized with `joblib` as:
```
models/
├── model.pkl
└── columns.pkl
```

## 💻 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ByteBard58/Wine_Research.git
cd Wine_Research
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the App
```bash
python app.py
```
The app will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🐳 Run the app directly via Dockerhub Image
A [**Dockerhub repository**](https://hub.docker.com/r/bytebard101/wine_research) is created where I have pushed the docker image which contains the entire **Wine_Research** app. 

The image is built on both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures, so that it can run on almost all major computers. You can run the app easily by using the Dockerhub Image. Here's how you can do it:
1. Install [**Docker Desktop**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and sign-in. Make sure the app is functioning properly.
  
2. Open Terminal and run:
```bash
docker pull bytebard101/wine_research:latest
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 bytebard101/wine_research:latest
```
3. If your machine faces a port conflict, you will need to assign another port. Try to run this:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 5001:5000 bytebard101/wine_research:latest
```
> If you followed Step 2 and the command ran successfully, then **DO NOT** follow this step.
4. The app will be live at localhost:5000. Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (or [http://127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) if you followed Step 3).

Check [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) to learn more about Docker and it's commands.

## 🍷 Web Interface

Users can input **physicochemical parameters** such as:

- Acidity levels (Fixed, Volatile, Citric)
- Sugar & Salt (Residual Sugar, Chlorides)
- Sulfur Dioxide levels
- Density & pH
- Alcohol content

The app returns the predicted quality tier (**Low**, **Average**, **High**) with a corresponding visual indicator.

**Note:** Due to the absence of front-end web development expertise and the lack of other contributors for the project, I had to resort to using AI tools (such as LLM services like ChatGPT™, Grok™, and GitHub Copilot™) to create a sophisticated front-end for the web app.
